# Project: Function Frontend 

This concludes module 2 of the ETH + AVAX Assessment by providing context for smart contracts and their functionalities. This is a project to create a simple contract then showing the values of those functions in frontend of the application.

# Description
The project is a Smart Contract interacting with Frontend to show the values of its function and by giving ETH and depositing it completes this assessment. With the help of the starter template, I was able to create and control how to obtain ETHs, run them in the Gitpod, and keep them running in a localhost in browser.

## Getting Started
Install Node.js and VSCode if you prefer coding in VSCode, or you can any IDE that is compatible. For me, I used Gitpod. After that, access and clone the Github using the Metacrafters Starter template and modify the terminal there!

# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, we will now follow these steps to run the application.

1. Install the npm packages inside the project directory by typing in the terminal: 'npm i'
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code or any IDE you are using like gitpod.
3. Type 'npx hardhat node' in the second terminal to start a local Ethereum block chain network using hadhat.
4. In the third terminal, type: 'npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js' to run the script to deploy the smart contract to the local Hardhat network.
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
